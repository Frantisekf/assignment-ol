## About The Project

I tried to not cheat the clock with the 120min time set for assignment so I left some bugs mostly it's incorrect BEM namings but there's also a bug in state logic ( should've opted for react context and not try to manage the state changes myself)

### How to run

to run project in the `dev` mode run the command from `package.json` 
``` 
yarn dev
```
